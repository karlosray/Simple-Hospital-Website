Apollo Hospitals is widely recognized as the pioneer of private healthcare in India, and was the country’s first corporate hospital. The Apollo Hospitals Group, which started as a 150-bed hospital and today, operates 9215 beds across 64 hospitals. A forerunner in integrated healthcare, Apollo has a robust presence across the healthcare spectrum. The Group has emerged as the foremost integrated healthcare provider in Asia, with mature group companies that specialize in insurance, pharmacy, consultancy, clinics and many such key touch points of the ecosystem. The Apollo Group has touched the lives of over 45 million patients, from 121 countries.
<br><br>Apollo Hospitals has taken the spirit of leadership well beyond business metrics. It has embraced the onus of keeping India, healthy. Taking cognizance of the undeniable fact that India is reeling under the onslaught of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), the Apollo Group has assumed the responsibility to educate, influence mindset. Increased focus on tactical initiatives like personalized preventive healthcare bears testimony to this new thrust. The Group has declared war on NCDs, and is leading the entire healthcare fraternity into this battle.<br><Br>Apollo pioneered Tender Loving Care (TLC) and it continues to be the magic that inspires hope, warmth and a sense of ease in the patients. Processes are relentlessly improved upon to ensure maximum patient-centricity.
<br><br>Along with excellence the Apollo philosophy rests on the pillars of technological superiority, a warm patient- centric approach, and a edge in forward-looking research. Apollo's spectacular success rests on sustained commitment and investments in each of these pillars.
<br><br>
Apollo Hospitals has always strongly believed in social initiatives that help transcend barriers. In keeping with this, the group has started several impactful programmes in this area. One among these initiatives is SACHi (Save a Child’s Heart Initiative) - a community service initiative with the aim of providing quality paediatric cardiac care to children from underprivileged sections of society suffering from heart diseases. Apollo also runs the SAHI (Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired) initiative to help poor children with hearing impairment, and the CURE Foundation which is focused on cancer screening, cure and rehabilitation for those in need. In the area of Cancer care Apollo has also joined hands with Yuvraj Singh's YOUWECAN to organize large-scale cancer screenings. Apollo regularly conducts comprehensive health screening camps across the nation. The Group runs the incredible successful Billion Hearts Beating campaign – a nationwide programme that has awakened India to heart healthiness.
